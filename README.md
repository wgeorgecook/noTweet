# noTweet, a celebration of Tweet Nothing Day
This extension removes the tweet stream from twitter.com urls when active. It also removes the tweet button.

## Background
If you're a fan of [Vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/vlogbrothers) or listen to [Dear Hank and John](https://www.patreon.com/dearhankandjohn), you might remember when Hank and John briefly mentioned how they wish we had a Day of No Tweeting. This is my realization of that desire, where you can be on twitter but not see other people's tweet nor tweet yourself.

## Usage
### To hide tweets / disable tweeting:
Click the noTweet icon in your extensions tool bar. Or, use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + T (Mac and PC)

### To show tweets / enable tweeting:
Click the icon again, or re-enter the keyboard shortcuts!

## Deployment
Clone this repository. Navigate to chrome://extensions in your browser and enable Developer Mode. Load an unpacked extension and point it to this repository.

The noTweet icon is a composite of two SVG icons
